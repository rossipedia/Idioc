> Don't Reinvent The Wheel, Unless You Plan on Learning More About Wheels

I've been looking into DI containers and IoC in general, and how they can benefit my development,
so I figured "Hey, why not just build one and see what happens?"

Also, it's much easier for me to understand somebody else's code if I've gone through the pain of 
creating something similar, and it was frankly a bit hard to follow some of the other DI container
frameworks out there.

I'll revamp this readme as the project progresses.
